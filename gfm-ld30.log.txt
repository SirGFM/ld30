  Well, that's it.
  Time to rest... o/

  Thanks for watching =D
  (maybe, give the game a try... it's buggy, but... why not?
XD)

------------------------------------------------------------

  Camera has been crashing, so I turned it off (unplugged,
actually) >_<
  Brb, gonna get some water

------------------------------------------------------------

  AAAAAAAAAARG >_<
  Web(cam) crashed and I just noticed it... luckly (?) the
screen's timelapse was unscathed

------------------------------------------------------------

  I may not have a game yet... but I've got a song for it! XD

------------------------------------------------------------

  I definitely shouldn't do it now... but whatever!
  Gonna take a little break! /o/

------------------------------------------------------------

  Trying pinkmonkeyhead's game...

------------------------------------------------------------

  Tired... I'll gonna take a 5 min break...
  o/

------------------------------------------------------------

  Gosh, I'll have to fix those controls... it's horrible >_<

------------------------------------------------------------

  It's been a while since my last commit... Better do it now

------------------------------------------------------------

  Lunch
  
  BACK!!

------------------------------------------------------------

  Gotta stop coding for a while and plan what I'm goint to
do next... I should probably implement the playstate
mechanic, then I can go back to adding content.

------------------------------------------------------------

  I need to be able to detect characters that are close to
each other to implement the AI... let's see how that works...

------------------------------------------------------------

  I don't what happened earlier, but it seems to be fine
now... '-'
  On a side note it's possible to attack!!!!
  _o\ \o\ \o/ /o/ /o_

------------------------------------------------------------

  And here we go again... on to be screwd by the language/
compiler/IDE.... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARG >_<

------------------------------------------------------------

  Gosh! I hadn't set my LD wallpaper. e____e
  That's what had been holding me back!! XD

------------------------------------------------------------

  Finally back!

------------------------------------------------------------

  Committed everything... time to sleep!

------------------------------------------------------------

  Bbr, gonna get some water

------------------------------------------------------------

  Nice, sprites!! =D
  I'll brb, then on to code some of the game. Hopefully I'll
have all the base code done by today (until I sleep), so I
make the game itself tomorrow (after I sleep XD) and polish
on sunday.

------------------------------------------------------------

  I wanna try some gfx I drew on the paper... then, on to 
code something! /o/

------------------------------------------------------------

  (NOOO, stop playing megaman 2... don't make me want to
play it >_<)

  There are three worlds:
   - Light world
   - Dark world
   - Nether world
  Yep, pretty default stuff...
  I don't really care right now if they are planes or actual
planets... BUT! someway or another light and dark has always 
been connected. Each race (light'ans dark'ans [dark'an
actually sounds cool... and like something that should
already exist XD]) didn't actually care about the other, but
neither they liked each other.
  For some time, both has been attacked by weird creatures
and they've started blaming each other. The real culprit,
though, are beings from the nether world (nether'ans... lame
=/). After each battle (which you play, alternatively
between light and dark people), you find an object left
behind by the other race and you must show it to your ruler
and decide if it's a proof that they were trying to attack
you or simply defending their selves (something like this).
  After the final battle (would be nice if both races
battled together...), the rulers of each world decide what
to do:
   - wage war on the other race
   - deem them as pacific and try to reach an agreement
  If only one of them wages war, the other is destroyed; if
both wage war, the nether race appear and finish off both;
if both try to reach an agreement, they live peacefully
thereafter.

  Well, this is pretty much what the game is about. I REALLY
FRIGGIN' LIKED IT! XD
  And to think I called this theme lame just a few minutes
ago... XD

------------------------------------------------------------

  Ok, I have this nice action/platformer game idea that uses
the theme in a simple but nice way... I can also set up some
nice mood (and 3 endings /o/)
  I'd normally brainstorm more... but I'll try to go with
that... let's see what happens (better XD)

------------------------------------------------------------

  I hadn't realized that this theme could be used with life/
death... that can also be a form of connected worlds... I
wonder how many games about that there will be.

------------------------------------------------------------

  Connected worlds gives me an idea of two (or more) worlds
literally connecteds... but I don't wanna follow that idea...
Also, light/dark world... thought it has been done a lot...

------------------------------------------------------------

  Seriously? Well I think this is my reaction to pretty much 
every theme (except for 10 seconds XD)

------------------------------------------------------------

Gonna sleep for some ours prior to the jam...
